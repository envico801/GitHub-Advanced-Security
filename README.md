## üìã Overview

This study guide is designed for security engineers, DevOps professionals, and developers preparing for the **GH-500: GitHub Advanced Security** certification. It covers planning, configuring, and managing GitHub Advanced Security features to secure code, automate vulnerability scanning, and enforce best practices across your repositories.

## üéØ Exam Objectives & Detailed Resources

The GHAS (GH-500) exam measures proficiency across five domains with the following weightings. Click on each objective link below to find a detailed skills breakdown mapped to specific Microsoft Learn modules and relevant documentation links.

- [Domain 1: Describe the GHAS security features and functionality (15%)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/gh-500#domain-1-describe-the-ghas-security-features-and-functionality-15)
- [Domain 2: Configure and use secret scanning (15%)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/gh-500#domain-2-configure-and-use-secret-scanning-15)
- [Domain 3: Configure and use Dependabot and Dependency Review (35%)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/gh-500#domain-3-configure-and-use-dependabot-and-dependency-review-35)
- [Domain 4: Configure and use Code Scanning with CodeQL (25%)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/gh-500#domain-4-configure-and-use-code-scanning-with-codeql-25)
- [Domain 5: Describe GitHub Advanced Security best practices, results, and how to take corrective measures (10%)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/gh-500#domain-5-describe-github-advanced-security-best-practices-results-and-how-to-take-corrective-measures-10)

## üí° Preparation Tips

- **Hands-on Practice:** Enable GHAS on a sample repository and walk through code scanning setup, secret scanning, and dependency review alerts.
- **Review Official Docs:** Familiarize yourself with [GitHub Advanced Security documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/github-security-features) and the exam skills outline.
- **Understand Workflows:** Know how to configure and customize GitHub Actions for scanning, triaging alerts, and integrating with issue trackers.
