### Part I - Github Advanced Security Part 1 Of 2

#### Chapter 1 - 1 Introduction To Github Advanced Security

Q:: =============================================  

##### In the analogy of building a house, what role does Code Scanning play, and why is this role most effective early in the construction process?

###### ID1

A:: =============================================  
Code Scanning acts as the "blueprint inspector." It's most effective early because it finds structural weaknesses (vulnerabilities) in the code (the "blueprints") *before* they are built into the final product. Fixing a flaw on paper is much easier and cheaper than fixing a crack in the foundation of a finished house.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-github-advanced-security/4-respond-to-security-alerts)
[Analogy link](https://github.com/envico801/GitHub-Advanced-Security/tree/main/GH-500T00%20Course/1-github-advanced-security-part-1-of-2/1-1-introduction-to-github-advanced-security)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Which GitHub Advanced Security feature is specifically designed to act as a "password guard," preventing sensitive information like API keys or passwords from being accidentally left in the code?

###### ID2

A:: =============================================  
Secret Scanning. Its job is to detect and even block commits that contain secrets, ensuring they don't become part of the project's public history.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-github-advanced-security/2-what-is-github-advanced-security)

Q:: =============================================  

##### How do the Dependency Graph and Dependabot work together to secure a project's software supply chain?

###### ID3

A:: =============================================  
The Dependency Graph acts as a complete "parts list" for the software. Dependabot reads this list and cross-references it with the GitHub Advisory Database (a list of known vulnerabilities) to check for any unsafe parts. If a match is found, it raises an alert, much like a safety recall notice for a faulty car part.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-github-advanced-security/3-create-culture-around-security)

Q:: =============================================  

##### At what specific point in a developer's workflow does GitHub Advanced Security typically intervene to check for vulnerabilities?

###### ID4

A:: =============================================  
GHAS intervenes when a developer submits new code in a "pull request," *before* it is merged into the main project. This allows developers to see and fix security issues immediately within their normal workflow, while the context is still fresh in their minds.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-github-advanced-security/4-respond-to-security-alerts)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is it a security risk for a project to have outdated dependencies?

###### ID5

A:: =============================================  
Outdated dependencies are a risk because new vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered in software components. An old version of a component might contain a known security flaw that attackers can exploit. Dependabot helps mitigate this risk by flagging outdated dependencies that have known security advisories.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-github-advanced-security/3-create-culture-around-security)

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) To secure a project, GHAS uses Code Scanning to inspect the {{c1::code's blueprints}}, Secret Scanning to protect {{c2::secrets}}, and Dependabot to manage the security of its {{c3::dependencies}}.

###### ID6

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) To secure a project, GHAS uses Code Scanning to inspect the code's blueprints (for vulnerabilities), Secret Scanning to protect secrets (like passwords and keys), and Dependabot to manage the security of its dependencies (third-party parts).

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-github-advanced-security/6-summary)

#### Chapter 2 - 2 Configure Dependabot Security Updates On Your Github Repo

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is it crucial for a developer to manage not just the direct dependencies they choose, but also the indirect dependencies they don't?

###### ID7

A:: =============================================  
A project's security is only as strong as its weakest link. An indirect dependency (a "part-of-a-part") can contain a vulnerability, and even if you didn't choose it directly, it's still running in your software. Failing to track and update these hidden dependencies can leave a significant security hole.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-dependabot-security-updates-on-github-repo/2-manage-your-dependencies-github)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the key difference in function between Dependabot and Dependency Review when securing a project's dependencies?

###### ID8

A:: =============================================  
Dependency Review is **proactive**; it acts as a "gatekeeper" on pull requests to *prevent* new vulnerable dependencies from being introduced. Dependabot is **reactive**; it acts as a "recall manager" for dependencies *already in* the project, alerting you when an existing part is found to be unsafe.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-dependabot-security-updates-on-github-repo/6-dependency-review)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What are the two primary events that will trigger Dependabot to generate a new security alert for your repository?

###### ID9

A:: =============================================  
An alert is generated when:

1. A new vulnerability affecting one of your existing dependencies is published to the GitHub Advisory Database, or
2. You add a new dependency to your project, which is then scanned and found to have a pre-existing vulnerability.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-dependabot-security-updates-on-github-repo/3-dependabot-alerts)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Using the analogy of building a car, what is the difference between a direct and an indirect dependency?

###### ID10

A:: =============================================  
A **direct dependency** is a major component you explicitly choose, like selecting an engine from Ford. An **indirect dependency** is a component that comes included with your choice, like the specific spark plugs inside that Ford engine, which you did not select yourself.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-dependabot-security-updates-on-github-repo/2-manage-your-dependencies-github)
[Analogy link](https://github.com/envico801/GitHub-Advanced-Security/tree/main/GH-500T00%20Course/1-github-advanced-security-part-1-of-2/1-2-configure-dependabot-security-updates-on-your-github-repo)

Q:: =============================================  

##### For Dependabot security updates to be enabled automatically on a repository for free, what condition must that repository meet?

###### ID11

A:: =============================================  
The repository must be public. This feature is provided by GitHub to help secure the open-source software ecosystem.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-dependabot-security-updates-on-github-repo/4-dependabot-security-updates)

Q:: =============================================  

##### To manage your workflow in the security notifications inbox, what search query would you use to filter the view to show only the alerts that you have already processed and marked as resolved?

###### ID12

A:: =============================================  
You would use the search filter `is:done`. This helps organize the inbox by separating active alerts from those that have already been handled.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-dependabot-security-updates-on-github-repo/5-manage-dependabot-notifications-reporting)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the primary source of information that Dependabot cross-references with your project's "parts list" (manifest) to identify security vulnerabilities?

###### ID13

A:: =============================================  
The GitHub Advisory Database. This is a comprehensive, constantly updated global database of known security vulnerabilities in software packages.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-dependabot-security-updates-on-github-repo/3-dependabot-alerts)

#### Chapter 3 - 3 Configure And Use Secret Scanning In Your Github Repository

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why are the settings for Secret Scanning locked and unchangeable on a public repository?

###### ID14

A:: =============================================  
The settings are locked because GitHub provides Secret Scanning as a free, standardized service to protect the entire public open-source community. This ensures a consistent baseline of security for all public projects. To gain control over the settings, the repository must be private and have a GitHub Advanced Security license.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-use-secret-scanning-github-repository/3-configure-secret-scanning)

Q:: =============================================  

##### When Secret Scanning finds a potential secret, what additional, crucial information does the "Validity Check" feature provide to help you prioritize your response?

###### ID15

A:: =============================================  
The Validity Check confirms whether the discovered secret is still **active** and can actually be used to access a service. This helps you prioritize alerts, allowing you to immediately address the most critical, live credentials over old, expired ones.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-use-secret-scanning-github-repository/4-use-secret-scanning)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What specific problem do "custom patterns" solve for an organization?

###### ID16

A:: =============================================  
They solve the problem of an organization using unique, internal secret formats that the default scanner wouldn't recognize. Custom patterns allow you to "teach" the scanner what your company-specific secrets look like, extending its detection capabilities beyond common, public service tokens.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-use-secret-scanning-github-repository/3-configure-secret-scanning)

Q:: =============================================  

##### The "security guard" analogy for Secret Scanning highlights that it searches more than just the current code. What other parts of a repository does it inspect?

###### ID17

A:: =============================================  
It inspects the project's entire history, developer notes (in "issues" and "pull requests"), and public comments. This comprehensive search ensures that secrets aren't hiding anywhere within the repository's data.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-use-secret-scanning-github-repository/2-what-is-secret-scanning)
[Analogy link](https://github.com/envico801/GitHub-Advanced-Security/tree/main/GH-500T00%20Course/1-github-advanced-security-part-1-of-2/1-3-configure-and-use-secret-scanning-in-your-github-repository)

Q:: =============================================  

##### To ensure the correct security team is notified when a secret is found, where in the repository settings must you go to configure the list of alert recipients?

###### ID18

A:: =============================================  
You must go to the **Advanced Security settings** of the repository. This is the central location for managing the configuration of all advanced security features, including who receives alerts.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-use-secret-scanning-github-repository/4-use-secret-scanning)

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) For a single organization, you can define up to {{c1::500 custom patterns}} to extend Secret Scanning's capabilities to find unique, internally-defined credentials.

###### ID19

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) For a single organization, you can define up to 500 custom patterns to extend Secret Scanning's capabilities to find unique, internally-defined credentials.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-use-secret-scanning-github-repository/3-configure-secret-scanning)

#### Chapter 4 - 4 Configure Code Scanning On Github

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the strategic difference between using a **triggered** code scan versus a **scheduled** code scan?

###### ID20

A:: =============================================  
A **triggered** scan provides immediate feedback on new changes (like in a pull request), catching vulnerabilities the moment they are introduced. A **scheduled** scan provides a periodic, comprehensive review of the entire codebase, which is useful for finding existing issues and checking against the very latest security rules.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-code-scanning/4-configure-code-scanning)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the purpose of the SARIF file format in the context of GitHub Code Scanning?

###### ID21

A:: =============================================  
SARIF acts as a standardized "inspection report." Its purpose is to provide a common format for any analysis tool (whether it's GitHub's native CodeQL or a third-party tool) to report its findings. This allows GitHub to ingest and display results from many different sources in one unified security interface.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-code-scanning/3-enable-code-scanning-with-third-party-tools)

Q:: =============================================  

##### In the code scanning process, what is the fundamental difference between a tool like `ESLint` and a tool like `GitHub Actions`?

###### ID22

A:: =============================================  
A tool like `ESLint` is an **analyzer** that *creates* the inspection report (the SARIF file) by checking the code for issues. `GitHub Actions` is a **delivery mechanism** or orchestrator that *runs the analyzer and uploads* that report to GitHub so the results can be displayed. One generates the findings, the other delivers them.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-code-scanning/3-enable-code-scanning-with-third-party-tools)

Q:: =============================================  

##### In the context of GitHub's native code scanning, what is the role of CodeQL?

###### ID23

A:: =============================================  
CodeQL is the powerful analysis engine that acts as GitHub's own native "code inspector." It treats code as data and queries it to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors, generating the results that are then displayed as code scanning alerts.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-code-scanning/2-what-code-scanning)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Besides using GitHub Actions and the CodeQL CLI, what is the third primary method for uploading a SARIF file to GitHub?

###### ID24

A:: =============================================  
The code scanning API. This method is used for programmatic or custom integrations where an external system needs to push analysis results directly to GitHub without using a standard workflow or command-line tool.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-code-scanning/3-enable-code-scanning-with-third-party-tools)

### Part II - Github Advanced Security Part 2 Of 2

#### Chapter 1 - 1 Identify Security Vulnerabilities In Your Codebase By Using Codeql

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is the initial step of "creating a database" so crucial for CodeQL's analysis, rather than simply searching the raw code files?

###### ID25

A:: =============================================  
Creating a database transforms the raw code into a structured, relational model. This allows CodeQL to understand the relationships between different parts of the code (like data flow and function calls), enabling it to find complex vulnerabilities that a simple text search would miss.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/codebase-representation-codeql/2-how-prepare-database-codeql)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is a CodeQL "query," and what is its role in the security analysis process?

###### ID26

A:: =============================================  
A CodeQL query is a question written in a special language that is used to "ask" the CodeQL database for specific code patterns. Its role is to act as the detective's instruction, guiding the search for known types of vulnerabilities, bugs, or other errors.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/codebase-representation-codeql/3-run-codeql-database)

Q:: =============================================  

##### In an automated pull request check, what is the function of the default failure threshold, and which severity level triggers it?

###### ID27

A:: =============================================  
The function is to act as an automated quality gate that prevents code with significant issues from being merged into the main branch. By default, this check is triggered to fail if CodeQL finds any problem with a severity level of **Error**.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/codebase-representation-codeql/4-understand-results)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the most direct way to optimize a slow CodeQL analysis without changing the amount of code being scanned?

###### ID28

A:: =============================================  
The most direct way is to increase the system resources available to the analysis, specifically by **increasing the memory (RAM)** and/or the number of CPU cores. More resources allow the CodeQL engine to process the database and queries more quickly.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/codebase-representation-codeql/5-troubleshoot-your-results)

Q:: =============================================  

##### (Cloze) The hierarchical command structure for using the CodeQL command-line tool follows the format codeql {{c1::[command]}} {{c2::[subcommand]}}.

###### ID29

A:: =============================================  
(Cloze) The hierarchical command structure for using the CodeQL command-line tool follows the format codeql [command] [subcommand].

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/codebase-representation-codeql/3-run-codeql-database)

#### Chapter 2 - 2 Code Scanning With Github Codeql

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the key philosophical difference between the QL language and a standard imperative language like Python?

###### ID30

A:: =============================================  
QL is **declarative**, meaning you describe *what* pattern you want to find, not the step-by-step process of *how* to find it. This makes it highly optimized for finding complex relationships and data-flow patterns in code, which is ideal for security analysis.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/code-scanning-with-github-codeql/4-what-is-ql)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Briefly describe the three distinct stages CodeQL uses to transform raw source code into an actionable security alert.

###### ID31

A:: =============================================  
1) **Database Creation:** It first extracts the code into a structured, relational database.

2) **Query Execution:** It runs queries (the inspection rules) against this database to find patterns.

3) **Result Interpretation:** It translates the raw query results into user-friendly alerts that pinpoint the exact location and nature of the potential issue.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/code-scanning-with-github-codeql/3-how-does-codeql-analyze-code)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What key capabilities does a custom `codeql-config.yml` file offer that make it more powerful than simply adding queries directly to a workflow file?

###### ID32

A:: =============================================  
A custom configuration file allows for more advanced control, such as **disabling the default queries**, specifying files or directories to **ignore** during a scan, and excluding specific unwanted rules from the default set.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/code-scanning-with-github-codeql/6-customize-your-scanning-workflow-with-codeql)

Q:: =============================================  

##### For a repository containing both Python and JavaScript, what feature can you use to optimize the CodeQL scanning time, and what principle does it operate on?

###### ID33

A:: =============================================  
You can use a **language matrix** in the GitHub Actions workflow. It operates on the principle of **parallelization**, running two separate analysis jobs (one for Python, one for JavaScript) at the same time, which is significantly faster than running them sequentially.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/code-scanning-with-github-codeql/10-custom-build-steps-for-code-scanning)

Q:: =============================================  

##### When does CodeQL's `autobuild` feature typically fail, and what must a developer provide in the workflow to overcome this failure for compiled languages?

###### ID34

A:: =============================================  
The `autobuild` feature typically fails when a project has a complex, non-standard, or unique build process. To overcome this, the developer must provide their own **custom build steps** in the workflow file, explicitly telling CodeQL how to compile the code before it can be analyzed.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/code-scanning-with-github-codeql/10-custom-build-steps-for-code-scanning)

#### Chapter 3 - 3 Github Administration For Github Advanced Security

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the core principle of the "shift-left" philosophy, and how does GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) facilitate it?

###### ID35

A:: =============================================  
The "shift-left" philosophy is about integrating security checks early in the development timeline, rather than leaving them for the end. GHAS facilitates this by providing automated security tools (like Code and Secret Scanning) that run directly in the developer's workflow, making security a continuous and proactive part of development.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/github-administration-github-advanced-security/2-what-is-github-advanced-security)

Q:: =============================================  

##### Why is the Security Overview dashboard a feature exclusive to GHAS licenses and not available on individual public repositories?

###### ID36

A:: =============================================  
The Security Overview is an organizational management tool designed to give a high-level, aggregate view of security risks across *many* repositories. This function is specific to the needs of a managed organization, whereas features like Code Scanning directly benefit the security of a single public project.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/github-administration-github-advanced-security/5-manage-github-advanced-security-features-alerts)

Q:: =============================================  

##### As a GitHub administrator, where would you navigate to enable GitHub Advanced Security for all new repositories across your entire organization?

###### ID37

A:: =============================================  
You would navigate to the organization's settings and find the **Code security and analysis** section. This is the central control panel for enabling and managing GHAS features at the organizational level.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/github-administration-github-advanced-security/3-enable-github-advanced-security)

Q:: =============================================  

##### What is the most effective administrative mechanism for ensuring consistent adoption and usage of security tools across all teams in an organization?

###### ID38

A:: =============================================  
The most effective mechanism is to **set a security policy at the organization level**. This allows an administrator to centrally enable or require specific security features for all or a subset of repositories, ensuring a consistent security posture without manual intervention on each project.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/github-administration-github-advanced-security/4-manage-access-github-advanced-security)

Q:: =============================================  

##### When configuring a security workflow in GitHub Actions, what is the critical security principle you should apply to the `GITHUB_TOKEN`?

###### ID39

A:: =============================================  
You must apply the **principle of least privilege** by correctly setting up the permissions for the `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The token should only be granted the minimum permissions necessary for the workflow to complete its job, which reduces the potential risk if the workflow were ever compromised.

[Documentation Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/github-administration-github-advanced-security/5-manage-github-advanced-security-features-alerts)

#### Chapter 4 - 4 Manage Sensitive Data And Security Policies Within Github

Q:: =============================================  

##### To enable users to effectively assess their risk, what two critical pieces of information must a well-formed security advisory contain?

###### ID40

A:: =============================================  
It must contain the **product and versions affected** (so users know if they are impacted) and the **severity level** of the vulnerability (so they know how urgently they need to act).
