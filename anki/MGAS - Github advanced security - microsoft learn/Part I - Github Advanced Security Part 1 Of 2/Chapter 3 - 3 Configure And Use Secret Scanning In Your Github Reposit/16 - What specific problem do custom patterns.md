========== Question ==========  

### What specific problem do "custom patterns" solve for an organization?  

========== Answer ==========  

They solve the problem of an organization using unique, internal secret formats that the default scanner wouldn't recognize. Custom patterns allow you to "teach" the scanner what your company-specific secrets look like, extending its detection capabilities beyond common, public service tokens.
