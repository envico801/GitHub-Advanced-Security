========== Question ==========  

### Why are the settings for Secret Scanning locked and unchangeable on a public repository?  

========== Answer ==========  

The settings are locked because GitHub provides Secret Scanning as a free, standardized service to protect the entire public open-source community. This ensures a consistent baseline of security for all public projects. To gain control over the settings, the repository must be private and have a GitHub Advanced Security license.
