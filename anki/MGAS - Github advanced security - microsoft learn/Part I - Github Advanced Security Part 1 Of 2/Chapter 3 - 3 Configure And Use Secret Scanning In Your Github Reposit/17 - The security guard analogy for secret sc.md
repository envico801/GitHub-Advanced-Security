========== Question ==========  

### The "security guard" analogy for Secret Scanning highlights that it searches more than just the current code. What other parts of a repository does it inspect?  

========== Answer ==========  

It inspects the project's entire history, developer notes (in "issues" and "pull requests"), and public comments. This comprehensive search ensures that secrets aren't hiding anywhere within the repository's data.
