========== Question ==========  

### What is the purpose of the SARIF file format in the context of GitHub Code Scanning?  

========== Answer ==========  

SARIF acts as a standardized "inspection report." Its purpose is to provide a common format for any analysis tool (whether it's GitHub's native CodeQL or a third-party tool) to report its findings. This allows GitHub to ingest and display results from many different sources in one unified security interface.
