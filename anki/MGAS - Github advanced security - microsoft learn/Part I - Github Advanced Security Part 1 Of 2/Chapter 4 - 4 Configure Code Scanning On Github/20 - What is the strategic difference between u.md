========== Question ==========  

### What is the strategic difference between using a **triggered** code scan versus a **scheduled** code scan?  

========== Answer ==========  

A **triggered** scan provides immediate feedback on new changes (like in a pull request), catching vulnerabilities the moment they are introduced. A **scheduled** scan provides a periodic, comprehensive review of the entire codebase, which is useful for finding existing issues and checking against the very latest security rules.
