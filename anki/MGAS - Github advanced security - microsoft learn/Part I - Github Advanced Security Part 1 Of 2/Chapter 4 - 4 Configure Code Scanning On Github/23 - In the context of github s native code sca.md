========== Question ==========  

### In the context of GitHub's native code scanning, what is the role of CodeQL?  

========== Answer ==========  

CodeQL is the powerful analysis engine that acts as GitHub's own native "code inspector." It treats code as data and queries it to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors, generating the results that are then displayed as code scanning alerts.
