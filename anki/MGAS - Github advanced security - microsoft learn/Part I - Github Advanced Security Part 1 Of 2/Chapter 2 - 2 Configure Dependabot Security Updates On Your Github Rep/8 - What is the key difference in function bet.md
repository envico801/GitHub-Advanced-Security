========== Question ==========  

### What is the key difference in function between Dependabot and Dependency Review when securing a project's dependencies?  

========== Answer ==========  

Dependency Review is **proactive**; it acts as a "gatekeeper" on pull requests to _prevent_ new vulnerable dependencies from being introduced. Dependabot is **reactive**; it acts as a "recall manager" for dependencies _already in_ the project, alerting you when an existing part is found to be unsafe.
