========== Question ==========  

### What are the two primary events that will trigger Dependabot to generate a new security alert for your repository?  

========== Answer ==========  

An alert is generated when:

1. A new vulnerability affecting one of your existing dependencies is published to the GitHub Advisory Database, or

2. You add a new dependency to your project, which is then scanned and found to have a pre-existing vulnerability.
