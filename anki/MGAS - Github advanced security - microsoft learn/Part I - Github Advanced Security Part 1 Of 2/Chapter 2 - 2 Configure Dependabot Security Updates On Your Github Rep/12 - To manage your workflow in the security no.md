========== Question ==========  

### To manage your workflow in the security notifications inbox, what search query would you use to filter the view to show only the alerts that you have already processed and marked as resolved?  

========== Answer ==========  

You would use the search filter `is:done`. This helps organize the inbox by separating active alerts from those that have already been handled.
