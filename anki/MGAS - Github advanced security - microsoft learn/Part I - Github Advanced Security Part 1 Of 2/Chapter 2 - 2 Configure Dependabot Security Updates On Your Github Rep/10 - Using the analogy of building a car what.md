========== Question ==========  

### Using the analogy of building a car, what is the difference between a direct and an indirect dependency?  

========== Answer ==========  

A **direct dependency** is a major component you explicitly choose, like selecting an engine from Ford. An **indirect dependency** is a component that comes included with your choice, like the specific spark plugs inside that Ford engine, which you did not select yourself.
