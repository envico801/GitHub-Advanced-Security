========== Question ==========  

### Why is it a security risk for a project to have outdated dependencies?  

========== Answer ==========  

Outdated dependencies are a risk because new vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered in software components. An old version of a component might contain a known security flaw that attackers can exploit. Dependabot helps mitigate this risk by flagging outdated dependencies that have known security advisories.
