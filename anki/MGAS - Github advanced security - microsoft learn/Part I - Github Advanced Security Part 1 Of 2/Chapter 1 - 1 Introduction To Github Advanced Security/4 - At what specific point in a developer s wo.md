========== Question ==========  

### At what specific point in a developer's workflow does GitHub Advanced Security typically intervene to check for vulnerabilities?  

========== Answer ==========  

GHAS intervenes when a developer submits new code in a "pull request," _before_ it is merged into the main project. This allows developers to see and fix security issues immediately within their normal workflow, while the context is still fresh in their minds.
