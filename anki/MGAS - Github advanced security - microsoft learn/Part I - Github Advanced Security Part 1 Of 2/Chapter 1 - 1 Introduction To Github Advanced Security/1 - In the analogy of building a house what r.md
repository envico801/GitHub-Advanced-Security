========== Question ==========  

### In the analogy of building a house, what role does Code Scanning play, and why is this role most effective early in the construction process?  

========== Answer ==========  

Code Scanning acts as the "blueprint inspector." It's most effective early because it finds structural weaknesses (vulnerabilities) in the code (the "blueprints") _before_ they are built into the final product. Fixing a flaw on paper is much easier and cheaper than fixing a crack in the foundation of a finished house.
