========== Question ==========  

### During a security incident investigation, what two fundamental questions about any event does the GitHub audit log help you answer?  

========== Answer ==========  

The audit log answers "who" (**the user that performed the action**) and "when" (**the date and time of the action**). This is crucial for establishing a timeline of events and attributing actions to specific users.
