========== Question ==========  

### What is the key philosophical difference between the QL language and a standard imperative language like Python?  

========== Answer ==========  

QL is **declarative**, meaning you describe _what_ pattern you want to find, not the step-by-step process of _how_ to find it. This makes it highly optimized for finding complex relationships and data-flow patterns in code, which is ideal for security analysis.
