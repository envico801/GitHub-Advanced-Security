========== Question ==========  

### Why is the initial step of "creating a database" so crucial for CodeQL's analysis, rather than simply searching the raw code files?  

========== Answer ==========  

Creating a database transforms the raw code into a structured, relational model. This allows CodeQL to understand the relationships between different parts of the code (like data flow and function calls), enabling it to find complex vulnerabilities that a simple text search would miss.
