========== Question ==========  

### What is a CodeQL "query," and what is its role in the security analysis process?  

========== Answer ==========  

A CodeQL query is a question written in a special language that is used to "ask" the CodeQL database for specific code patterns. Its role is to act as the detective's instruction, guiding the search for known types of vulnerabilities, bugs, or other errors.
