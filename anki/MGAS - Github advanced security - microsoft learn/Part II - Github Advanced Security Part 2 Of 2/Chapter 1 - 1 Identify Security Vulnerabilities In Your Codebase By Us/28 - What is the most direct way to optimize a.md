========== Question ==========  

### What is the most direct way to optimize a slow CodeQL analysis without changing the amount of code being scanned?  

========== Answer ==========  

The most direct way is to increase the system resources available to the analysis, specifically by **increasing the memory (RAM)** and/or the number of CPU cores. More resources allow the CodeQL engine to process the database and queries more quickly.
