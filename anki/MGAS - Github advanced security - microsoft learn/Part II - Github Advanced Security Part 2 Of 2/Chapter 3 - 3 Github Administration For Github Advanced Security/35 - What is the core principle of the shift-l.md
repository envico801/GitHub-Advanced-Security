========== Question ==========  

### What is the core principle of the "shift-left" philosophy, and how does GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) facilitate it?  

========== Answer ==========  

The "shift-left" philosophy is about integrating security checks early in the development timeline, rather than leaving them for the end. GHAS facilitates this by providing automated security tools (like Code and Secret Scanning) that run directly in the developer's workflow, making security a continuous and proactive part of development.
