========== Question ==========  

### What is the most effective administrative mechanism for ensuring consistent adoption and usage of security tools across all teams in an organization?  

========== Answer ==========  

The most effective mechanism is to **set a security policy at the organization level**. This allows an administrator to centrally enable or require specific security features for all or a subset of repositories, ensuring a consistent security posture without manual intervention on each project.
