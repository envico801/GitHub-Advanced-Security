========== Question ==========  

### Why is the Security Overview dashboard a feature exclusive to GHAS licenses and not available on individual public repositories?  

========== Answer ==========  

The Security Overview is an organizational management tool designed to give a high-level, aggregate view of security risks across _many_ repositories. This function is specific to the needs of a managed organization, whereas features like Code Scanning directly benefit the security of a single public project.
