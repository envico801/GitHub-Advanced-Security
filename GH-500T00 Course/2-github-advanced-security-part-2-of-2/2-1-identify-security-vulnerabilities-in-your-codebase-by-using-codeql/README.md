## 2. [GitHub Advanced Security Part 2 of 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/github-advanced-security-2/)

### 2.1. [Identify security vulnerabilities in your codebase by using CodeQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/codebase-representation-codeql/)

#### [The Big Picture: Becoming a Code Detective](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/codebase-representation-codeql/2-how-prepare-database-codeql)

*   **Simple Idea:** CodeQL is a powerful tool that lets you investigate your code for security flaws. Think of it like a detective's toolkit. Instead of running it automatically inside GitHub, this module is about using the **CodeQL command-line tool (CLI)** yourself. This gives you more control and lets you run inspections on your own computer or server.

*   **The Detective's Process (Three Main Steps):**
    1.  **Create a Database:** First, the detective takes all the evidence (your source code) and organizes it into a structured **database**. It's like taking messy piles of documents and filing them neatly so you can search them easily.
    2.  **Run Queries:** Next, the detective asks specific questions to find clues. These questions are called **queries**. A query might be, "Show me every place where user input is used to build a database command," which could find a major security flaw.
    3.  **Analyze Results:** Finally, the detective reviews the answers to the questions (the query results) to decide if a crime (a vulnerability) has been committed.

#### [1. What does CodeQL first do when you're creating a database?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/codebase-representation-codeql/2-how-prepare-database-codeql)

*   **Simple Idea:** This question asks about the very first step in the detective's process. Before you can ask any questions, you need to organize the evidence.
*   **The Process:** CodeQL reads through every single file of your source code. For each file, it creates a structured, "relational" representation of it. This means it understands how all the pieces of your code relate to each otherâ€”what function calls another, where data comes from, etc. It then puts all this structured information into the database.
*   **Simplified Answer:** It **extracts a single relational representation of each source file.** It's turning your code into a highly organized, searchable map.

#### [2. What is the format of the command for creating and analyzing a CodeQL database from the CLI?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/codebase-representation-codeql/3-run-codeql-database)

*   **Simple Idea:** When you use a command-line tool, you type commands in a specific order. This question asks for the correct order for using CodeQL.
*   **The Structure:** The structure is always `tool [action] [details]`.
    *   First, you name the tool you're using: `codeql`.
    *   Next, you say what *major action* you want to perform, like `database` or `query`. This is the `[command]`.
    *   Finally, you give the specific detail of that action, like `create` or `analyze`. This is the `[subcommand]`.
*   **Example:** `codeql database create` (Tool: codeql, Command: database, Subcommand: create).
*   **Simplified Answer:** The format is `codeql [command] [subcommand]`.

#### [3. By default, which severity level causes a pull-request check failure during code scanning?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/codebase-representation-codeql/4-understand-results)

*   **Simple Idea:** When CodeQL finds problems, it gives them a severity rating, like a doctor diagnosing an illness as minor, serious, or critical. When a developer tries to add new code (in a "pull request"), you can set up a rule that says, "If the code has any problems that are 'serious' or worse, don't let it in!" This question asks what the default "serious" level is.
*   **The Default Rule:** By default, GitHub considers any problem that CodeQL flags as an **`Error`** to be serious enough to block the new code. This is the highest level of non-security-related problem.
*   **Simplified Answer:** `Error`.

#### [4. Which is one way to optimize CodeQL analysis runtimes?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/codebase-representation-codeql/5-troubleshoot-your-results)

*   **Simple Idea:** The detective's work (running a CodeQL analysis) can sometimes be slow, especially on a very large case (a big codebase). This question asks for a way to speed things up.
*   **How to Make it Faster:** A computer's "thinking power" depends on two main things: its brain (CPU cores) and its short-term memory (RAM). If the detective's work is slow, giving them more "thinking power" will help.
*   **Simplified Answer:** **Increase the memory** (and/or the number of cores). More resources mean the analysis can run faster. Analyzing *less* code would also work, but increasing memory is a direct way to improve performance on the same amount of code.

#### [In a Nutshell:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/codebase-representation-codeql/7-summary)

Using the **CodeQL CLI** is like being a hands-on code detective. You first **create a database** to organize the evidence, then you **run queries** to ask questions and find vulnerabilities. The command format is always `codeql [command] [subcommand]`. The results are rated by severity, and by default, any **Error** will block new code. To make your investigation faster, you can give your computer more resources, like **increasing its memory**.
